This project contains a housing affordability calculator. Open `index.html` in a
browser to use it.

The estimator now applies a dynamic inflation model when projecting property
prices. Inflation starts at the chosen scenario rate and gradually decreases
after five years toward a longâ€‘term floor. The floor can now be customized via
an "Inflation floor" input in the interface.

## Professional Tools & Libraries

To build a robust housing affordability calculator, consider integrating the following tools:

- **React** or **Vue.js** for a scalable user interface.
- **TypeScript** to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase.
- **Chart.js** for visualizing projections (already used).
- **Python** with **Pandas** for data analysis or importing external datasets.
- **Docker** to standardize development and deployment.

The main application logic now resides in `main.js`, which is loaded from `index.html`.
